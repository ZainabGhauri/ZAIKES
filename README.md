# ZAIKES

# Abstract:
Zaikes security is a cyber-security application that offer multiple image processing techniques for better transmission and interpretation of the encoded data. As Data is largely and repeatedly communicated over the internet in form of digital images. The safety and security of images is an important and difficult task. Various techniques are used to secure the digital image, such as watermarking, encryption and steganography. These are the techniques for the security and safety of digital images to achieve security goals, i.e. availability (CIA), confidentiality, and integrity. Moreover, Image processing techniques such as motion detection, Image restoration and thermal imaging play a vital role in preventing crime and criminal cases. During investigation, the image processing technology can offer proofs for the litigation and trial of the case, the investigators and officers take this as a clue or hint, after which they resolve the case.  Police officers use thermal imaging techniques to see thing without being seen by the criminals. Suspects and weapons can be easily seen in total darkness.  Generating fake thermal images using Image processing is preferred as thermographic cameras are complicated to handle and are quite expensive.

# Introduction 
Many sectors are presently implementing automatic image processing technology. Evaluation of the quality of components or work pieces, crop monitoring in agriculture, and spotting new threats are all examples of typical uses. With new advancements in technology on daily bases, safety and security of data is of utmost concern of all the organizations across the globe. In a world of rapidly increasing cybercrime, only providing network security is not enough. Big organization including the army use image processing methods to secure and transfer data across the globe. Image steganography is used to provide security to images sent using electric mode. An image or secret message can be sent hidden inside another image so that the eavesdropper ‘s can’t detect its presence. Whereas, in Watermarking a portion of text or logo is superimposedatop of a document or image, and when it comes to the copyright security and marketing of digital products or images, it's a crucial process.
Moreover, Image restoring, thermal imaging and motion detection techniques are further used by police officers and security agents to improve the pictorial information to draw clues and hints to investigate crime scenes. Subtraction of consecutive frames and background subtraction method for detecting the motion from consecutive frames within a video are implemented for real time applications.
Zaikes Security offer the following Image analysis procedure to improve the security and representation of pictorial information:
1.	Steganography
2.	Watermarking
3.	Motion detection
4.	Thermal imaging
5.	Text Restoration
